# Global-Climate-Health-Analysis

Using Tableau and the dataset; Global Climate Health Impact Tracker (2015-2025) by Sohum Gokhale posted on Kaggle.com, I have done an analysis on the data in tableau. 

The tableau visualizations explore various different types of factors and issues impacting different regions and specific countries. 
Visualizations Covered within this Tableau analysis include:
1) Air Quality Index by Region (Bar Chart)
2) Heat Days by Region (Treemap)
3) Waterborne Disease by Country colored by Region (Bar Chart)
4) Precipitation by Region (Bar Chart)
5) Drought Indicator by Country (Map)
